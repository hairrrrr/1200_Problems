    <h1>Problem D: Coin Toss</h1>
    <p>
    <b>Input</b>: <tt>cointoss.in</tt><br>
    <b>Output</b>: <tt>cointoss.out</tt>
    </p>
<p>In a popular carnival game, a coin is tossed onto a table with an area
that is covered with square tiles in a grid. The prizes are determined
by the number of tiles covered by the coin when it comes to rest: the
more tiles it covers, the better the prize. In the following diagram,
the results from five coin tosses are shown:</p>
<p><img src="cointoss.png"></p><p>In this example:</p>
<ul>
  <li>coin 1 covers 1 tile<br></li>
  <li>coin 2 covers 2 tiles<br></li>
  <li>coin 3 covers 3 tiles<br></li>
  <li> coin 4 covers 4 tiles<br></li>
  <li> coin 5 covers 2 tiles</li>
</ul>
<p>Notice that it is acceptable for a coin to land on the boundary of the playing
area (coin 5). In order for a coin to cover a tile, the coin must cover
up a positive area of the tile. In other words, it is not enough to
simply touch the boundary of the tile. The center of the coin may be at
any point of the playing area with uniform probability. You may assume
that (1) the coin always comes to a rest lying flat, and (2) the player
is good enough to guarantee that the center of the coin will always
come to rest on the playing area (or the boundary). </p>

<p>The probability of a coin covering a certain number of tiles depends on the
tile and coin sizes, as well as the number of rows and columns of tiles
in the playing area. In this problem, you will be required to write a
program which computes the probabilities of a coin covering a certain
number of tiles.</p>

<h2>Input</h2>

<p>The first line of input is an integer specifying the number of cases to follow. For each case, you
will be given 4 integers m, n, t, and c on a single line, separated by
spaces. The playing area consists of m rows and n columns of tiles,
each having side length t. The diameter of the coin used is c. You may
assume that 1 &lt;= m, n &lt;= 5000, and 1 &lt;= c &lt; t &lt;= 1000.</p>

<h2>Output</h2>


<p>For each case, print the case number on its own line. This is followed by
the probability of a coin covering 1 tile, 2 tiles, 3 tiles, and 4
tiles each on its own line. The probability should be expressed as a
percentage rounded to 4 decimal places. Use the format as specified in
the sample output. You should use double-precision floating-point
numbers to perform the calculations. "Negative zeros" should be printed
without the negative sign.</p>

<p>Separate the output of consecutive cases by a blank line.</p>

<h2>Sample Input</h2>

5 5 10 3
7 4 25 20
10 10 10 4

<h2>Sample Output</h2>
<pre>
Case 1:
Probability of covering 1 tile  = 57.7600%
Probability of covering 2 tiles = 36.4800%
Probability of covering 3 tiles = 1.2361%
Probability of covering 4 tiles = 4.5239%

Case 2:
Probability of covering 1 tile  = 12.5714%
Probability of covering 2 tiles = 46.2857%
Probability of covering 3 tiles = 8.8293%
Probability of covering 4 tiles = 32.3135%

Case 3:
Probability of covering 1 tile  = 40.9600%
Probability of covering 2 tiles = 46.0800%
Probability of covering 3 tiles = 2.7812%
Probability of covering 4 tiles = 10.1788%
